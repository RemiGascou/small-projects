--[ 0 - The Unicode Standard

While   exploiting   buffer   overflows,   we  sometime face a difficulty :
character transformations. In fact, the exploited program may have modified
our buffer, by setting it to lower/upper case, or by getting rid of
non-alphanumeric characters, thus stopping the attack as our shellcode
usually can't run anymore. The transformation we are dealing here with is
the transformation of a C-type string (common zero terminated string) to a
Unicode string.
